a) RAW data is given as file names

Mode 1 = Mode1.csv
Mode 2 = Mode2.csv
Mode 3 = Mode3.csv
Mode 4 = Mode4.csv
Mode 5 = Mode5.csv
Mode 6 = Mode6.csv

b) One cycle represents 170 samples in time.
Maximum digital amplitude quantisation are 1023.
Ratio of sensor conversion added to the value to obtain real values of amplitude.

c) R-Y-B equals to 1-2-3 sequence of phase.

d) v=voltage 
Example: v2= voltage phase two (phase yellow)
Voltage digital quantization unit = 1.2Volt/sample

e) I=current
Example: i1= current phase one (phase red)
Current digital quantization unit = 0.85Amp/sample
